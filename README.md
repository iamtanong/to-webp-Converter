# To .webp File Converter

### convert PNG and JPG files to webp file which have less sizes with Python and Pillow

This is my **mini** project during I develop my profile website ([iamtanong.github.io](https://github.com/iamtanong/iamtanong.github.io)). I found a problem that **Github Pages takes too much time** too load plenty of images. So I decided to reduce ALL images size by **converting to Webp files with this project**.
